🚀 **Availability of Supplementary Materials:** 
All supplementary materials for this work, including Appendix S1 (Component Rationale) and Appendix S2 (Online Reproducibility Package: code, models, and instructions) are available from the authors upon reasonable request.

## Appendix S2. Online Reproducibility Package (Code • Models • Instructions)
**Scope:** This appendix accompanies the paper and provides everything needed to run, test, and extend the full pipeline using the single Python script shared with the submission (teacher partial fine‑tuning → distillation + semi‑hard triplet → few‑shot evaluation → dynamic quantization → speed demo). It mirrors the implementation used to generate the results in the paper.
## S2.1 What’s in the Scripts 
* (imports, seeding, Colab mount) → Reproducibility & environment
* Dataset classes (WeedNet, SubsetWithLabels, SubsetWithTransform)
* Transforms & splits (StratifiedShuffleSplit)
* Teacher (EfficientNet‑B7) with partial unfreeze of features.6–8 + 2048‑D head 
* Student backbones (MobileNetV3‑Small, ShuffleNetV2‑1.0, EfficientNet‑B0) each → 2048‑D 
* Weighted embedding ensemble (softmax‑learned weights) 
* <b>Losses:</b> MSE KD on embeddings + TripletMarginLoss with semi‑hard miner (margin=1.0) 
* Few‑shot evaluation via prototypical episodes (EasyFSL TaskSampler) 
* Quantization: post‑training dynamic INT8 on nn.Linear 
* Speed demo: synthetic episodes throughput
* Ablation analysis
**Main pipeline + 3 ablations:** `weed_classification_pipeline_plus_ablation_analysis`  
  Implements the full pipeline (EfficientNet‑B7 partial fine‑tuning → MSE knowledge distillation + semi‑hard triplet loss → few‑shot evaluation → dynamic INT8 quantization).  
  **Includes:** three ablation studies (**Teacher‑only**, **Distillation‑only**, **Triplet‑only**), the **inference speed demo**, and the **figures/visualizations** used in the paper.

- **Ablation notebooks (separate):**
  - **No partial fine‑tuning (Frozen teacher):** `<weed_classification_pipeline_no_partial_fine_tuning_ablation>.ipynb`  
    Keeps the teacher frozen at ImageNet initialization; trains students with **MSE + semi‑hard triplet**.
  - **Single student only:** `<weed_classification_pipeline_single_student>.ipynb`  
    Replaces the ensemble with a single lightweight backbone (MobileNetV3) and trains with **MSE + semi‑hard triplet**.

> ℹ️ The main file contains the end‑to‑end pipeline, three ablations, inference speed benchmarking, and the plots reproduced in the paper. The **“no partial fine‑tuning”** and **“single student”** ablations are provided as two separate `.ipynb` notebooks.

> 📓 Notes on Notebooks
All provided .ipynb notebooks contain headers and comments clearly explaining the purpose of each cell. You can run them step by step for transparency and learning. To reproduce results:
Install the required libraries listed in the setup cell.
Run the code cell by cell in order.
